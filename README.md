# MandelbrotSet
A visualisation of the MandelbrotSet in Processing

The Mandelbrot set is a captivating mathematical set named after Benoit Mandelbrot. It consists of complex numbers and showcases intricate fractal patterns. By iterating a simple formula, it determines whether a complex number is part of the set. The boundary of the set, known as the "edge of chaos," reveals mesmerizing self-similar structures at different scales. Zooming in uncovers a world of intricate shapes and filaments. The Mandelbrot set has inspired art, computer graphics, and music, highlighting the captivating beauty that arises from basic iterative processes.
